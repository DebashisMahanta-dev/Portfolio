      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Debashis Mahanta, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student at Government College of Engineering, Keonjhar.
Iâ€™m driven by a deep curiosity for technology and innovation, and I love transforming ideas into functional, impactful solutions.

My core interests lie in Full Stack Web Development (MERN) and Data Analytics â€” building scalable web apps, visualizing insights, and optimizing performance through clean, efficient code.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring emerging tech trends, experimenting with creative side projects, and continuously learning new tools that push my boundaries.

ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities in software development or data analytics where I can apply my technical skills, learn from real-world challenges, and contribute to innovative projects that make a difference</p>
